            <Paragraph>
              The widely-accepted theory that catalyst transfer polymerization
              (CTP) proceeds through an associative intermediate between M(0)
              catalysts and the Ï€-system of a conjugated polymer in order to
              give chain-growth kinetics is flawed. Consensus on this theory has
              been established over a number of years, allowing weaker and
              weaker studies to be accepted as evidence of this phenomenon. In
              this paper I present an alternative theory: that ring-walking is
              likely not real, certainly not important, and has hindered the
              progress of CTP.

            The Journal of Contrarian Chemistry is focused on challenging
            established consensus across all fields of chemistry. In every
            field, papers are published that are widely recognized in an
            unspoken manner as being of poor quality and/or drawing incorrect
            conclusions. This creates a situation where there is both a public
            and a private knowledge of any given problem or system. We aim to
            bridge the gap between these two spheres, lowering barriers to entry
            and saving researchers time by providing them with information that
            is all signal and no noise.
